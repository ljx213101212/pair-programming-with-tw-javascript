### Dependency Injection

1. Decoupling
2. Testability
 -  Easily mock or stub
 -  when testing the recommend function, you can provide a mock getReadings without relying on the actual implementation.
3. Flexibility and Reusability
 - Same handler function can work with different implementations of getReadings
4. Maintainability
  - Changes in the data access layer (readingsData) don't directly impact the route handlers.
